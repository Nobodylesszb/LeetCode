#You are given a data structure of employee information, which includes the employee's unique id, his importance value and his direct subordinates' id.

# For example, employee 1 is the leader of employee 2, and employee 2 is the leader of employee 3. They have importance value 15, 10 and 5, respectively. Then employee 1 has a data structure like [1, 15, [2]], and employee 2 has [2, 10, [3]], and employee 3 has [3, 5, []]. Note that although employee 3 is also a subordinate of employee 1, the relationship is not direct.

# Now given the employee information of a company, and an employee id, you need to return the total importance value of this employee and all his subordinates.
